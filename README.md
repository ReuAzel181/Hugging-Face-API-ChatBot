# ChatBot Using Hugging Face API

This repository contains a simple chatbot application that utilizes the Hugging Face API to generate responses. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate basic chatbot functionality and is a great starting point for exploring natural language processing and chatbot development. I am just exploring the chatbot, and it often gives nonsense responses.
